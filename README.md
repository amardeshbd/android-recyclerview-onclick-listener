This is a sample research project that consolidates how RecyclerView item click listener is 
added using best practices followed in the industry and community.

## Background
Personally, I have been relying on Googling, StackOverflow, and Google's official Android developer 
guide to implementing click listener for `RecyclerView` for some time now. Even though, I have 
settled on the solution recommended by Google, I still wanted to explore the past and 
present (as of `2020`) on what is current and what are the confusions.

Whenever I [Googled](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+recyclerview+click+listener), 
I could see I am not the only one looking for answers 🤷, 
so I decided to dig deeper and document some of the current recommendations from Google
from different sources. 

## Objective

List some historical implementation, as well as current recommended best practice on how to set 
item click listener on `RecyclerView`.

> NOTE: This is relatively new repository. Once I am finished with research I will try to 
> write an article summarizing my findings 🕵️
